# Description of the project

# Instructions for use

Press the keys from 0-4 to access the different visuals we all have created!

# How it works

We used the Minim libary build into Processing to listen to the audio we have and turn it into a number. With that number we can use it to change the location, speed, colour and so much more of our visuals! This means that the visuals update live with the audio.
